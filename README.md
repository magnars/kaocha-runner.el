# kaocha-runner.el

An emacs package for running Kaocha tests via CIDER.

**Breaking:** Commands in this package are now prefixed with `kaocha-runner-`
instead of just `kaocha-`. Update your keybindings accordingly.

## Installation

I highly recommend installing kaocha-runner through elpa.

It is available on [melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net/):

    M-x package-install kaocha-runner

Note that you must include kaocha in your dev dependencies for this to run in
the repl. The kaocha docs suggests creating a separate `:kaocha` profile, but
skip that if you want to run it from the repl.

## Usage

Kaocha runner exposes the following commands:

- `kaocha-runner-run-test-at-point`

   Runs the test at point in the current namespace.

- `kaocha-runner-run-tests`

   Runs tests in the current namespace. With a prefix argument, it runs test id provided by the user.

- `kaocha-runner-run-all-tests`

   If you want to bind a key for running all tests directly, without having to
   prefix it, this is the command for you.

- `kaocha-runner-show-warnings`

   If you get any warnings from Kaocha, the report will just say *X warnings*.
   You can display them with this command. Given a prefix argument, it
   displays the warnings in a separate window.

- `kaocha-runner-hide-windows`

   When displaying results, kaocha-runner pops up a window. This command hides
   it again. You can also switch to the window and kill it normally, if you
   prefer that.

## Keybindings

Pick your own. Here are mine:

```cl
(define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "C-c k t") 'kaocha-runner-run-test-at-point)
(define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "C-c k r") 'kaocha-runner-run-tests)
(define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "C-c k a") 'kaocha-runner-run-all-tests)
(define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "C-c k w") 'kaocha-runner-show-warnings)
(define-key clojure-mode-map (kbd "C-c k h") 'kaocha-runner-hide-windows)
```

## Configuration

The way kaocha-runner invokes kaocha is guided by two custom vars:

- `kaocha-runner-repl-invocation-template`

    which defaults to `(do (require 'kaocha.repl) %s)`. The `%s` is replaced
    with either `(kaocha.repl/run ...)` or `(kaocha.repl/run-all ...)`

- `kaocha-runner-extra-configuration`

    which defaults to `{:kaocha/fail-fast? true}`.

So by default, kaocha-runner does this when running tests:

```clj
(do (require 'kaocha.repl) (kaocha.repl/run {:kaocha/fail-fast? true}))
```

You can change this by changing the custom vars mentioned above.

Note that kaocha-runner *does not evaluate your code in any way*. You'll have to
evaluate the code first, with a `(reset)` or just `C-c C-k` in the buffer.

To remedy this, you can change the `kaocha-runner-repl-invocation-template` to
include a reset of your choice.

Also, if you want to shave ~150ms from each test run, you can remove the require
from the template. In that case, you'll have to require it yourself.

You can also customise the tests, failure, and details window heights by setting
the following custom vars to the desired value:

- `kaocha-runner-ongoing-tests-win-min-height`

The minimum height in lines of the output window. The window is show when tests
are taking long to run, to show the ongoing progress from kaocha.

- `kaocha-runner-failure-win-min-height`

The minimum height in lines of the failure window.

- `kaocha-runner-details-win-max-height`

The maximum height in lines of the details window.
